## üéØ Next Steps

### 1. ‚úÖ Program Already Configured
The frontend is already updated with the correct program ID in:
- `/home/steven/solpoker/lib/solana/config.ts`

### 2. üîë Initialize Admin Account (First Time Only)

Before using the poker program, you need to initialize the admin account:

```bash
# You'll need to create a script or use the frontend to call initialize_admin
# This sets up the admin configuration for the program
```

### 3. üöÄ Start Your Application

```bash
cd /home/steven/solpoker

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local  # If you have one

# Edit .env.local and add:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_POKER_PROGRAM_ID=HLwbRZWAGjK7w5T61xegvj37v1H3nATNdTcypAfbFRaq
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Your app will be available at: **http://localhost:3000**

### 4. üß™ Test the Application

1. **Connect Wallet**: Click "Connect Wallet" and use Phantom, Solflare, or another Solana wallet (set to devnet)
2. **Get Devnet SOL**: Get test SOL for your wallet from https://faucet.solana.com/
3. **Create Tournament** (Admin): Use the admin dashboard to create a tournament
4. **Join Tournament**: Players can join with their wallets
5. **Play Poker**: Test the full game flow

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Program Instructions Available

Your deployed program supports these instructions:

1. **initialize_admin** - Set up admin configuration (rake percentage, admin wallet)
2. **initialize_tournament** - Create a new poker tournament
3. **join_tournament** - Players join and escrow their buy-in
4. **distribute_prizes** - Distribute winnings after tournament ends
5. **withdraw_rake** - Admin withdraws collected rake
6. **cancel_tournament** - Cancel and refund if tournament doesn't fill

---

## üìä Program Configuration

Default settings in your smart contract:
- **Max Players per Tournament**: 6
- **Rake Calculation**: Configurable by admin
- **Escrow Security**: All buy-ins held in program PDAs
- **Prize Distribution**: Automatic via smart contract

---

## üîê Security Notes

1. **Keep Your Keypairs Safe**:
   - Deployer: `/home/steven/devnet-deployer.json`
   - Program: `/home/steven/solpoker/solana-program/target/deploy/poker_escrow-keypair.json`

2. **Program Authority**: 
   - You control the program with wallet: `3rWf9fKhQFFsjAfyM1cgtoBpeLZL75b77C8o8Fz9QeNF`
   - You can upgrade the program at any time

3. **Backup Seed Phrase**:
   ```
   invite peanut myth hole way mountain razor device comfort attract riot snack
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep this safe!** This recovers your deployer wallet.

## üîÑ Updating the Program

If you need to update the program later:

```bash
cd /home/steven/solpoker/solana-program/programs/poker-escrow
source $HOME/.cargo/env
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"

# Make your code changes, then rebuild
cargo build-sbf

# Deploy the update (uses same program ID)
cd ../..
solana program deploy target/deploy/poker_escrow.so \
  --program-id target/deploy/poker_escrow-keypair.json
```

---

## üìù Monitoring Your Program

### View Program Logs:
```bash
solana logs HLwbRZWAGjK7w5T61xegvj37v1H3nATNdTcypAfbFRaq
```

### Check Program Info:
```bash
solana program show HLwbRZWAGjK7w5T61xegvj37v1H3nATNdTcypAfbFRaq
```

### View Transactions:
```bash
solana confirm <TRANSACTION_SIGNATURE>
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If the frontend can't find the program:
1. Check network is set to devnet
2. Verify program ID in `lib/solana/config.ts`
3. Ensure wallet is connected and on devnet

### If transactions fail:
1. Check wallet has enough SOL
2. View logs with `solana logs` command
3. Verify admin account is initialized

### If you need help:
- Check logs for error messages
- Use Solana Explorer to inspect transactions
- Verify all accounts are initialized properly
